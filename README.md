# The Pronko Consulting Theme for Magento 2
Welcome to the Pronko Consulting theme repository. This repository contains a Magento 2 theme. 

Feel free to customize it for your own purposes.

All development steps and changes are documented and discussed on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/maxpronko).

# About
The Pronko Consulting theme is created to show best practices on Magento 2 theme development. The theme is based on Magento 2 Blank theme.
The repository is created and maintained by [Max Pronko](https://www.maxpronko.com/) and [Pronko Consulting Team](https://www.pronkoconsulting.com). Feel free to contribute. This is a great opportunity to learn custom theme development best practices.

## Development
It is recommended to use [modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman) package manager for the theme development. Make sure to download modman before use.

Read [Magento 2 Module in a Separate Repository](https://www.maxpronko.com/magento-2-module-in-a-separate-repository/) post for details.

From the root Magento directory run the following command:
```bash
modman clone git@github.com:mcspronko/magento-2-pronko-consulting-theme.git
```

This command will clone the repository into the .modman/magento-2-pronko-consulting-theme directory and create a symlink in the app/code/design/Pronko folder.

Any modifications in the app/code/design/Pronko directory will be reflected in the .modman/magento-2-pronko-consulting-theme.
